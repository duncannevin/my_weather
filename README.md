# My Weather

My Weather Application is a comprehensive weather forecasting service built using FastAPI. It is designed to provide users with detailed weather forecasts based on their queries. The application leverages the capabilities of FastAPI to manage asynchronous endpoints efficiently, ensuring that users receive fast and accurate weather information. Additionally, it includes a frontend component enabling users to visually interact with the weather data.

## Features

- Weather Forecast Retrieval: Users can obtain weather forecasts by querying the service with specific parameters such as location and date.
- Caching Mechanism: The application employs a caching layer powered by Redis to store frequently accessed data, reducing load times and enhancing performance.
- Static and HTML Serving: The application serves static files, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, from designated directories, providing a rich and interactive user interface.
- RESTful API Endpoints: The weather information is accessible through well-defined RESTful API endpoints, facilitating easy integration with other services and applications.

## Project Structure

- Backend (FastAPI): The core of the application is built with FastAPI, offering a robust RESTful API and handling all backend logic and data processing.
- Frontend (Static Files): The application serves static files including HTML views, which allow users to interact with the backend services through a web interface.
